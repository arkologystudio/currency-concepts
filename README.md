### Setup your local Python environment

Option 1: custom environment with Pipenv

pip3 install pipenv
```

Navigate to project route & create a new virtual environment:

```
pipenv shell
```

Install dependancies

```
pipenv install --dev
```

To enter / exit your virtual environment, in your project root, type:

```
pipenv shell #to enter
deactivate # or "CMD-D" to exit
```

Having trouble? See the following [guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) on Streamlit

OR

Setup virtual environment with Annaconda

### Run the app

In the command line within your virtual environment, run:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should now be available in a new browser window
